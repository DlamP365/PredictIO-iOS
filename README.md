# PredictIO-iOS
predict.io offers mobile developers a battery-optimized SDK to get normalised sensor results. Available for iOS and Android. It gives you real-time updates when a user starts or ends a journey. With this trigger come contextual details for the mode of transportation (car vs. non-car).

##### Use Cases
Look through the [Use cases](https://github.com/predict-io/PredictIO-iOS/wiki/Use-Cases) where this SDK can be used.

## Requirements
[Sign up](http://www.predict.io/sign-up/) for API key, iOS 7.0+, ARC

## Installation
### Using CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. Copy and paste the following lines into your podfile:
```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'PredictIO', '~> 0.10.0'
```
> You should not use TextEdit to edit the podfile because TextEdit likes to replace standard quotes with more graphically appealing quotes. This can cause CocoaPods to get confused and display errors, so itâ€™s best to just use Xcode or another programming text editor.

### If not using CocoaPods
If you don't use CocoaPods, you can manually add predict.io lib to your Xcode project, see [Manual integration of predict.io](https://github.com/predict-io/PredictIO-iOS/wiki/Manual-integration-of-PredictIO) guide for more details.

### Getting Location Events in the Background
predict.io requires location updates even when your Application is in background. Check out [Getting Location Events in the Background](https://github.com/predict-io/PredictIO-iOS/wiki/Getting-Location-Events-in-the-Background) for more details.
